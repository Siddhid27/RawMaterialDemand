Project Description: Raw Material Demand Forecasting System

This project is a machine learning-based demand forecasting system designed to help industries predict future raw material requirements. Using the Food Demand Forecasting dataset from Kaggle, the model learns patterns from past data such as week number, center location, product ID, prices, and promotions to accurately forecast upcoming demand. The system features a Streamlit-based interactive interface where users can input product and pricing details to instantly predict expected demand. It also includes a trend visualization tool that shows how demand changes across multiple weeks, helping businesses plan procurement schedules, manage inventory efficiently, and reduce material wastage — ultimately improving production planning and service levels.
